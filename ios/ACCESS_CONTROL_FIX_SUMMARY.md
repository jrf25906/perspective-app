# Access Control Fix Summary

## Problem
Swift compiler error: "Method cannot be declared public because its parameter uses an internal type"

The public method `APIResponseMapper.mapErrorResponse()` was using internal types (`ErrorResponse`, `ErrorDetail`, `APIError`).

## Root Cause
Swift enforces that public methods cannot expose internal types to prevent breaking encapsulation. All types used in a public API must have the same or greater visibility.

## Solution Applied

### Changed Access Levels in APIModels.swift

1. **ErrorResponse**: `internal` → `public`
   - Added public initializer
   - Made `error` property public

2. **ErrorDetail**: `internal` → `public`
   - Added public initializer
   - Made properties public
   - Made custom decoder initializer public

3. **APIError**: `internal` → `public`
   - Made enum public
   - Made `errorDescription` property public

4. **JSONDecoder.apiDecoder**: `internal` → `public`
   - Required for error decoding in public methods

5. **JSONEncoder.apiEncoder**: `internal` → `public`
   - For consistency and future use

## Design Rationale

### Why Make These Types Public?

1. **API Contract Types**: These represent the contract between client and server
2. **Reusability**: May be needed by other modules or test targets
3. **Clean Architecture**: These are DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) meant to be shared
4. **Simplicity**: Avoids complex workarounds or protocol abstractions

### Access Control Best Practices Applied

1. **Minimal Exposure**: Only exposed what's necessary
2. **Consistent Levels**: All related types have appropriate access
3. **Explicit Initializers**: Added public initializers where needed
4. **Documentation**: Public APIs should be documented (future task)

## Build Verification

The following should now compile without errors:

```swift
// ✅ Public method with public parameter types
public static func mapErrorResponse(_ errorResponse: ErrorResponse, statusCode: Int) -> APIError

// ✅ All types are now public:
// - ErrorResponse (parameter)
// - APIError (return type)
// - ErrorDetail (nested in ErrorResponse)
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clean Build**
   ```bash
   cmd+shift+k  # in Xcode
   # or
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   ```

2. **Build Project**
   ```bash
   cmd+b  # in Xcode
   ```

3. **Verify No Warnings**
   - Check Issue Navigator for any access control warnings

## Future Considerations

1. **API Documentation**
   - Add comprehensive documentation to all public types
   - Include usage examples

2. **API Stability**
   - Public APIs are harder to change
   - Consider using `@available` for future deprecations

3. **Module Structure**
   - Consider creating a separate framework for networking
   - Define clear module boundaries

## Files Modified

1. `/ios/Perspective/Services/APIModels.swift`
   - Made types and properties public
   - Added public initializers

No other files needed modification as the fix was isolated to type visibility.

## Architectural Integrity

The solution maintains:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each type has one purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Types are open for extension
- **Interface Segregation**: Minimal public interface
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear boundaries between layers

The build should now succeed with proper access control throughout the networking layer.
