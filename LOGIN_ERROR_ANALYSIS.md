# Login Error Analysis

## Problem Summary

The iOS app is receiving a valid error response from the backend but is still trying to decode it as an `AuthResponse` (which expects a `user` field). This indicates that our NetworkClient fixes are not being properly applied in the authentication flow.

## Diagnostic Output Analysis

### What the Backend Sent:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
    "message": "Invalid email or password"
  }
}
```

### What the iOS Client Expected:
```json
{
  "user": { ... },
  "token": "..."
}
```

### The Decoding Error:
```
keyNotFound(CodingKeys(stringValue: "user", intValue: nil)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Response Handling Order
Despite our NetworkClient fix, the app is still:
1. Receiving an error response (INVALID_CREDENTIALS)
2. Attempting to decode it as `AuthResponse`
3. Failing because there's no `user` field in an error response

### Issue 2: Authentication Service Not Using Updated NetworkClient
The `AuthenticationService` might be:
1. Using the old `performRequest` method that doesn't check for errors first
2. Not properly integrated with our error handling improvements
3. Bypassing the NetworkClient entirely

## Why This Keeps Breaking

### 1. **Separation of Concerns Violation**
- Error handling is scattered across multiple layers
- No clear boundary between success and error paths
- NetworkClient and AuthenticationService have overlapping responsibilities

### 2. **Type Safety Issues**
- Using the same decoding path for success and error responses
- No compile-time guarantee that errors are handled before success decoding
- Relying on runtime checks instead of type system

### 3. **Integration Points**
- Multiple places where response handling can go wrong
- No single source of truth for response processing
- Difficult to trace the exact flow

## Architectural Issues

### Current Flow (Broken):
```
Login Request
    ↓
NetworkClient.performRequest()
    ↓
Try to decode as AuthResponse ← FAILS HERE
    ↓
Error handling (never reached)
```

### Expected Flow:
```
Login Request
    ↓
NetworkClient.performRequest()
    ↓
Check HTTP status & error structure
    ↓
Route to error handling OR success decoding
    ↓
Return appropriate result
```

## Solution Architecture

### Principle 1: Fail Fast
Check for errors immediately, before any success processing.

### Principle 2: Type-Safe Response Handling
Use Swift's type system to enforce correct handling at compile time.

### Principle 3: Single Responsibility
Each component should have one clear job:
- NetworkClient: HTTP communication and initial response routing
- ResponseHandler: Type-safe response processing
- AuthenticationService: Business logic and state management

### Principle 4: Clear Contracts
Define explicit interfaces between components with no ambiguity about error vs success paths.
