# iOS Compatibility Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The iOS app was expecting snake_case fields (`current_streak`, `echo_score`) but the backend was sending camelCase fields (`currentStreak`, `echoScore`) after our transformation fix. This was the OPPOSITE of what we initially thought.

## Root Cause
- iOS models had `CodingKeys` enums mapping to snake_case field names
- Backend was correctly transforming to camelCase
- This created a mismatch where iOS couldn't decode the responses

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Unified on camelCase API Contract** ✅
- Updated all iOS models to expect camelCase fields
- Removed snake_case mappings from CodingKeys enums
- Maintains consistency with JavaScript/TypeScript conventions

### 2. **iOS Models Updated** ✅
Updated CodingKeys in:
- `User` model and `BiasProfile`
- `Challenge` and all related models
- `RegisterRequest` and `GoogleSignInRequest`
- All challenge-related structs (11 total)

### 3. **Backend Request Handling** ✅
- Created `camelCaseRequestParser` middleware
- Converts incoming camelCase from iOS to snake_case for DB
- Ensures backward compatibility

### 4. **Complete User Data Transformation** ✅
- Fixed ProfileController to use UserTransformService
- All user endpoints now return properly transformed data
- Consistent camelCase throughout API responses

## Testing & Verification

### Before Fix
```
❌ keyNotFound "current_streak"
❌ Looking for snake_case fields
❌ echo_score NOT found in user object
```

### After Fix
```
✅ All fields in camelCase
✅ echoScore: number (0)
✅ currentStreak: number (0)
✅ No snake_case fields found
✅ Proper ISO8601 date formatting
```

## Files Changed

### iOS Changes
1. `ios/Perspective/Models/User.swift` - Removed snake_case CodingKeys
2. `ios/Perspective/Models/Challenge.swift` - Updated all CodingKeys to camelCase

### Backend Changes
1. `backend/src/services/UserTransformService.ts` - Transforms DB → API
2. `backend/src/middleware/camelCaseRequestParser.ts` - Handles iOS requests
3. `backend/src/controllers/profileController.ts` - Uses transformation
4. `backend/src/middleware/validateApiResponse.ts` - Validates camelCase
5. `backend/src/setup/middleware.setup.ts` - Added request parser

## Applied Principles

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Single transformation service for all user data
- Reusable middleware for request parsing
- Centralized field naming convention

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Easy to extend for new models
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean API contracts
- **Dependency Inversion**: iOS depends on API contract, not implementation

## Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ iOS decoding errors completely eliminated
- ✅ Consistent camelCase API contract
- ✅ Type-safe field access in iOS
- ✅ Better developer experience

### Long-term Benefits
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Clear API documentation
- Reduced debugging time
- Better iOS/backend alignment

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Production**: Watch for any remaining decoding errors
2. **Documentation**: Update API docs to specify camelCase
3. **Code Generation**: Consider generating iOS models from TypeScript
4. **Testing**: Add automated contract tests to CI/CD

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check both sides**: The issue was iOS expecting snake_case, not backend sending wrong format
2. **Consistency matters**: Pick one convention (camelCase) and stick to it
3. **Validation helps**: The middleware caught the exact mismatch
4. **Test end-to-end**: Mock data can hide real API issues
