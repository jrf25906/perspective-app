# Authentication Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The iOS app was failing to authenticate users with the error:
```
keyNotFound(CodingKeys(stringValue: "user", intValue: nil)
```

This occurred because:
1. The backend returns an error response format: `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`
2. The iOS client was attempting to decode this as an `AuthResponse` (expecting `user` and `token` fields)
3. The NetworkClient was checking for errors AFTER attempting to decode the success response

## Solution Implemented

### iOS NetworkClient Fix (COMPLETED)

Modified `/ios/Perspective/Services/NetworkClient.swift` to:

1. **Check HTTP status codes FIRST** before attempting any decoding
2. **Detect error responses** even in 200 OK responses (backend sometimes returns 200 with error content)
3. **Map error codes** to appropriate `APIError` cases for better error handling

Key changes:
- Added `mapErrorResponse` method to properly categorize backend errors
- Reordered the response handling flow to validate before decoding
- Added comprehensive error detection for both HTTP status codes and response content

### Code Changes

```swift
// Before: Decode first, validate later (WRONG)
.tryMap { data, response in
    // Process JSON
    // Validate response
    return data
}
.decode(type: T.self, decoder: JSONDecoder.apiDecoder)

// After: Validate first, decode later (CORRECT)
.tryMap { data, response in
    // 1. Check HTTP status
    // 2. Check for error response structure
    // 3. Process JSON if needed
    // 4. Return clean data for decoding
    return processedData
}
.decode(type: T.self, decoder: JSONDecoder.apiDecoder)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Error responses** will be properly caught and mapped to appropriate `APIError` cases
2. **Success responses** will only be decoded after confirming no errors exist
3. **User-friendly error messages** will be displayed instead of decoding errors

## Testing the Fix

1. Build and run the iOS app
2. Attempt to login with invalid credentials
3. You should see appropriate error messages instead of decoding failures

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Consistency**: Consider implementing a response interceptor to ensure all errors follow the same format
2. **API Documentation**: Document the expected response formats for all endpoints
3. **Integration Tests**: Add comprehensive tests for error scenarios
4. **Migration Fix**: Resolve the database migration issues to ensure all tables are created properly

## Architecture Improvements

The fix follows SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: NetworkClient only handles HTTP communication
- **Open/Closed**: Error mapping is extensible for new error codes
- **Dependency Inversion**: Error handling depends on protocols, not concrete types

This fix addresses the immediate issue while laying groundwork for more robust error handling across the entire application.
