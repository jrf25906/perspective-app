# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The Perspective App follows a client-server architecture with native mobile applications communicating with a Node.js backend API.

## Components

### Mobile Applications
- **Android**: Native Android application built with Kotlin
- **iOS**: Native iOS application built with Swift

### Backend API
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or local storage

### Shared Resources
- **Assets**: Images, icons, and other media files
- **Documentation**: API specs and guides

## Data Flow

1. Mobile app sends request to backend API
2. Backend validates authentication and authorization
3. Backend processes request and interacts with database
4. Backend returns response to mobile app
5. Mobile app updates UI based on response

## Security

- JWT-based authentication
- HTTPS encryption in transit
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration

## Deployment

### Backend
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline
- Environment-specific configurations
- Database migrations

### Mobile Apps
- App store distribution
- Over-the-air updates
- Crash reporting and analytics

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database read replicas
- CDN for static assets
- Caching strategies (Redis)
- Microservices architecture (future)
